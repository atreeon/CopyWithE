TODO
1 check that my passed in subtypes all implement the class specified
3 need to order my switch statement better
    LectureWithType extends Lecture
    LectureWithType must come before Lecture otherwise we will return Lecture instead of LectureWithType every time

PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE
4 automatically discover all classes that implement the extensionMethodClass and add that to my list of types - don't think this is possible though (https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/40386)

DONE
âˆš check for isAbstract on the passed in types
